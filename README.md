# Pedestrian-detection-assistance-system
This project is called Pedestrian Detection Assistance System. It uses YOLOv8 to detect people (pedestrians) on the road using images or videos. It helps in preventing accidents by alerting drivers when a person is in front of the car. The system works in real-time and is useful for self-driving cars and driver safety systems.
